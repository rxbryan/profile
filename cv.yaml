about: |
  I am a polyglot programmer with a passion for designing and implementing complex software architectures,
  particularly those involving intricate interactions across multiple domains such as networks and
   computer systems. I have extensive experience in developing open source software, 
   and have successfully led the development of Hyperledger Indy read and Ledger resigner. 
  I am also deeply interested in applied cryptography, with a focus on zero-knowledge proofs and
   schnorr signatures.
